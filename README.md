# weather_dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic weather dashboard using weather APIs. Students will fetch data from external APIs, present it in a user-friendly manner, and implement responsive design principles.

## Project Overview

This web application displays current weather information and a 5-day forecast for a user-specified location. It fetches data from the WeatherAPI, processes it, and presents it in a visually appealing way. The project incorporates best practices in UI/UX design to ensure functionality and user engagement.

## Features

- Current Weather Display: Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the selected city.
- 5-Day Forecast: Displays maximum and minimum temperatures and weather conditions for each day in the forecast.
- Responsive Design: Ensures usability across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling the application for a clean and modern look.
- JavaScript : Fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the UI.
- WeatherAPI: Providing weather data for the specified location.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a city name and click 'Search' to view weather information.
4. The current weather and 5-day forecast will be displayed.

## Project Structure
